# Academic Project Page Template

Abstract:
The growing conflict between rising vehicle volumes on roads and limited road capacity has drawn significant attention to optimizing space allocation for individual vehicles. The lane-free approach, which allows vehicles to move without the constraints of lane boundaries, shows the potential to accommodate higher traffic densities. However, its reliance on a high penetration rate of autonomous vehicles (AVs) poses safety challenges during the early stages of AV deployment. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-Special Width Approach Lane (multi-SWAL) management method, which uses SWALs to reduce lane widths while maintaining a structured, lane-based framework. This approach is adaptable to various scenarios, ranging from limited AV penetration during initial deployments to full AV adoption in mature systems. The proposed method integrates lane change guidance with adaptive signal control to enhance both spatial and temporal utilization of intersection resources. By dynamically optimizing vehicle positioning across multiple lanes and coordinating discharge timing, the method minimizes average delays and improves intersection efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the multi-SWAL approach significantly outperforms conventional lane designs and other existing methods across
various traffic demand levels. Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate its robustness in effectively managing intersections under diverse traffic conditions.

## Start using the template

**IMPORTANT!** Make sure to replace the `favicon.ico` under `static/images/` with one of your own, otherwise your favicon is going to be a dreambooth image of me.

## Components

- Teaser video
- Image carousel
- YouTube video embedding
- Video carousel
- PDF poster viewer
- BibTeX citation

## Customization

The HTML file has TODO comments showing what to replace:

- Paper title, authors, institution, conference
- Links (arXiv, GitHub, etc.)
- Abstract and descriptions  
- Videos, images, and PDFs
- Related works in the dropdown
- Meta tags for SEO and social sharing

### Meta Tags
The template includes meta tags for better search engine visibility and social media sharing. These appear in the `<head>` section and help with:
- Google Scholar indexing
- Social media previews (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Search engine optimization

Create a 1200x630px social preview image at `static/images/social_preview.png`.

## Tips

- Compress images with [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)
- Use YouTube for large videos (>10MB)  
- Replace the favicon in `static/images/`
- Works with GitHub Pages
