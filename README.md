Abstract:
The growing conflict between rising vehicle volumes on roads and limited road capacity has drawn significant attention to optimizing space allocation for individual vehicles. The lane-free approach, which allows vehicles to move without the constraints of lane boundaries, shows the potential to accommodate higher traffic densities. However, its reliance on a high penetration rate of autonomous vehicles (AVs) poses safety challenges during the early stages of AV deployment. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-Special Width Approach Lane (multi-SWAL) management method, which uses SWALs to reduce lane widths while maintaining a structured, lane-based framework. This approach is adaptable to various scenarios, ranging from limited AV penetration during initial deployments to full AV adoption in mature systems. The proposed method integrates lane change guidance with adaptive signal control to enhance both spatial and temporal utilization of intersection resources. By dynamically optimizing vehicle positioning across multiple lanes and coordinating discharge timing, the method minimizes average delays and improves intersection efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the multi-SWAL approach significantly outperforms conventional lane designs and other existing methods across
various traffic demand levels. Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate its robustness in effectively managing intersections under diverse traffic conditions.
